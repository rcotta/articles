# The Whatsapp scam, and how to protect yourself from this threat

As you may already know, we Brazilian are very creative for the good but unfortunately for the bad too. And some of our (bad) people just found out how to get money from stealing Whatsapp accounts. But this could be even worse.

## How the scam works

For this scam to work, the scammer needs the help from someone from the phone company to disable the victim's SIM card and active the same phone number on another card. Once it's done, the person with the new SIM is able to restore the affected Whatsapp account on his or her phone.

Here in Brazil the scammers check for messages history and ask for money from people that trust on the victim ("hey, daddy ... would you lend me some money? please transfer to this account ..."), but it's not difficult to imagine that once they have access to your chat and files history, it could be even worse.

I was in shock when I noticed that someone could get my Whatsapp data so easily, and I am someone without too many secrets to hide ... :-)

## How to protect yourself

You can protect yourself by enabling the two step verification in Whatsapp, that craates a pin code that needs to be informed on critical operations (like reinstalling the app).

The process is straightforward as explained [here](https://www.whatsapp.com/faq/en/general/26000021): open WhatsApp > Settings > Account > Two-step verification > Enable.

I noticed a side effect after the change: now I have to inform the PIN code once in a while (once every 2 days?). But having my account protectd definetely worths it.

Although I am not sure how fragile (or robust) are phone companies outside Brazil, I'd definetely enable this protection as new forms of this very same scam may appear. Or may already exist.
